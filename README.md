# Sami's Learning Environment

Welcome! My name is Sami Elsayed and I'm currently a sophmore at [Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology](https://tjhsst.fcps.edu). I am a current Sysadmin at my school's computer systems lab ([@tjcsl](https://github.com/tjcsl)) in which I work on maintaining the school's main infrastructure. I love programming and building things, some of my favorite projects that I'm currently making or have made:

- [The Techbook (currently private)](https://github.com/selsayed25/techbook): Home to the world's information on every aspect of Tech. It's a collection of the best explanation on things in once nice place!
- [Snakepy](https://github.com/selsayed25/snakepy) - A Snake game using Pygame
- [A drawing app using Python](https://github.com/selsayed25/python-drawing-app)
- [My very own website!](https://github.com/selsayed25/mywebsite)
- [DiligentOS](https://github.com/selsayed25/diligentOS) - My own Operating System

...and so much more!

I'm also the Founder of Cardinal @cardinaldevorg, a organization dedicated to helping people across the Washington D.C Metro area, to learn programming and the tech world through projects and events!
